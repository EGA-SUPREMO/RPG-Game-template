# RPG Game template
Framework that makes building 2D games a breeze!
---

![](https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/RPG-Game-template/blob/master/game.png)

A template that can be extended to be a 2D game.

It a simple game where you can run, walk, pick up items, advance levels and have enemies that you can aim and kill, and they will follow you using a dijkstra algorithm.

It lacks of quests, levels, items and needs a improvement before it can be played by an average user.

Similar to RPG games from 90's.

## Notes
The code was written in Esperanto, but if you are interested in this project, I can translate and maybe document the important parts for you! however the development paused until I found a good reason to continue.
